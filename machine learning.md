# machine learning 

machine  learning  is looking for a function .It can do some maths and spite an answer .

approaches:

1. supervised learning 
2.  unsupervised learning 
3.  reinforce  learning 





## regression 

### step

#### 1. model

we suppose  a  linear model 

y=b+âˆ‘wixi

w and b are parameter	



#### 2. loss function

we can use loss  function to evaluate our model . loss  function is a measure of how  good  a prediction model dose in term  of  being  able  to predict  the expected outcome .



#### 3. gradient decent 

gradient decent  is a  iterative optimization   algorithm for finding a local minimum of a differentiable function .
